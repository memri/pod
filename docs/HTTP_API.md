# About
There are various components that communicate with the Pod:

* Clients like iOS app, web app;
* Indexers that enrich data/photos/other content;
* Importers/Downloaders that import data from other systems, e.g. from evernote.

All of that data goes through Pod HTTP API.
This document explains the data types that Pod can store,
and current API that let's you store or retrieve the data.


## Items
Items are the main thing that is stored in Pod.
You could see it as the main holder for Pod-s data.

### item's mandatory properties

* `_type`, case-sensitive item's type. Can never be changed once created.
* `uid`, the unique identifier of the item, signed 64-bit integer.
* `dateCreated`, creation date _as seen by the client_, stored as
DateTime (see [Understanding the schema](../README.md#understanding-the-schema)).
Set by the client by default.
* `dateModified`, last modification date _as seen by the client_. Set by the client by default.
* `deleted`, a flag that, if set to `true`, will mean that the item was deleted by the user.
It is still possible to restore the item later on.
Permanent delete will be supported in the future, based in deletion date.
* `version`, a number that is incremented with each update from the client.
This field is fully controlled by the Pod, all input on it will be ignored and it will always
store the real number of updates that happened to an item.

### item's additional properties
Additional properties can be set dynamically via the [Schema](../README.md#schema).


## Edges
Edges connect items together to form a
[directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).
Pending on design decisions we're going to make, edges might also possibly
support properties in the future (don't rely on it yet).

### edge's mandatory properties

* `_source`, the `uid` of the item it points *from*
* `_target`, the `uid` of the item it points *to*
* `_type`, the type of the edge. Cannot be modified once created.

### edge's additional properties (currently hardcoded)
* `edgeLabel`, an optional string
* `sequence`, an optional integer meaning the client-side ordering of items
(e.g. items reachable from a "root" item using edges of a particular _type)


# API

### Authentication & Credentials
Some endpoints require additional authentication / credentials.

In text below, `databaseKey` means a 64-character hex string to be used with sqlcipher.
It should be generated by the client once and kept there.
This key will never be written to disk by Pod, and is used to open the database.
You can read more on how this key is used in sqlcipher
[here](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher).

In text below, `owner_key` means the full client-s public [ED25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) key
(see also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519)).
It should be encoded as 64-character hex string.

It is also used as authentication mechanism in the current version of Pod.
Pod will calculate the `blake2b` hash of the `owner_key` bytes,
and if it matches pre-defined values, will accept the request.
When you need to calculate the hash to send to Pod, you can use one of the libraries:
[javascript](https://github.com/emilbayes/blake2b)
(or the [wasm](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js) version,
[example](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js/blob/master/test/sodium_utils.js#L113)),
[swift](https://github.com/jedisct1/swift-sodium/blob/master/Sodium/GenericHash.swift),
[rust](https://crates.io/crates/blake2),
[libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/hashing/generic_hashing).
During development, you can also just send any request to the Pod and see it's logs, which will contain the owner check denial along with the expected hash.
Additionally, you can use the word "ANY" for owner list in Pod, which will make Pod accept
requests from any owner -- so called multi-tenancy.

⚠️ UNSTABLE: The use of this key for authentication will be changed in the nearest future.
Note that incorrect database key (below) will also fail any request.


### GET /version
Get version of the Pod: the git commit and cargo version that it was built from.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/get_item/$uid
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": null
}
```
Get a single item by its `uid`.

⚠️ UNSTABLE: currently, the endpoint returns an empty array if an item is not found,
or an array with 1 item if item exists.
In the future, the endpoint might return an error if item was not found,
and the object itself if the item was found.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/all_items
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": null
}
```
Get an array of all items.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/items/
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```
Create a single item.

* `uid` property MUST be present in input json
* `version` from the input json will be ignored,
* `dateCreated` if not present, will be set by the backend
* `dateModified` if not present, will be set by the backend

Returns `uid` of the created item. Returns an error if an `uid` did already exist.

⚠️ UNSTABLE: In the future, the endpoint might allow creating items without `uid` being explicitly set,
and just return the `uid` to the caller.


### PUT /v2/$owner_key/items/$uid
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```
Update a single item.

* `uid` from the input json will be ignored
* `_type` from the input json will be ignored
* `dateCreated` from the input json will be ignored
* `dateModified` if not present, will be set by the backend
* `version` from the input json will be ignored,
and in fact will be increased by 1 from previous database value.

Returns an empty object if the operation is successful.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/bulk_action/
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": {
    "createItems": [
      { "uid": 12345, "_type": "Person", ... }, ...
    ],
    "updateItems": [
      { "uid": 12345, ... }, ...
    ],
    "deleteItems": [ uid, uid, uid, ...],
    "createEdges": [
      { "_source": uid, "_target": uid, "_type": "AnyString", ... }, ...
    ],
    "deleteEdges": [
      { "_source": uid, "_target": uid, "_type": "Some Type", ... }, ...
    ],
  }
}
```
Perform a bulk of operations atomically.

If `createEdges` array is not empty, all items in `createItems` MUST have `uid` set.

Returns an empty object if the operation is successful.


### DELETE /v2/$owner_key/items/$uid
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": null
}
```
Mark an item as deleted:
* Set `deleted` flag to `true`
* Update `dateModified` (server-s time is taken)


### POST /v2/$owner_key/search_by_fields/
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": { "_type": "Label", "color": "#CCFF00" }
}
```
Search items by their fields.
The endpoint will return an array of all items with exactly the same properties.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/get_item_with_edges/$uid
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
}
```
Get item, with edges of any type pointing from that item,
and all item's properties that those edges point to.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/items_with_edges
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": [1, 20, 30, 100000]
}
```
Given an input array of `uid`-s, for each `uid`, find the underlying item,
all its edges and all items that these edges point to.

If at least one of the `uid`-s doesn't exist, return 404 NOT_FOUND for the whole request.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/run_service/downloaders/{service}/{data_type}
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": null
}
```
Run a downloader for different services with different data types, e.g. Evernote with note.
Unsupported service or data type will yield 400 BAD_REQUEST error.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/run_service/importers/{data_type}
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": null
}
```

Unsupported data type will yield 400 BAD_REQUEST error.


### POST /v2/$owner_key/run_service/indexers/$uid
```json
{
  "databaseKey": "2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99",
  "payload": null
}
```
Run an indexer on an item with the given uid.
